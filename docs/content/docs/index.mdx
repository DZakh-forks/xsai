## Why use the xsAI?

xsAI has a similar interface to the Vercel AI SDK, but is significantly smaller.

This makes it ideal for a variety of scenarios that require smaller bundle size, such as web applications, cli running through npx, and so on.

## `llms.txt`

You can access the entire xsAI documentation in Markdown format at https://xsai.js.org/llms.txt.

This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window)

questions about the xsAI based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the xsAI:

1. Copy the documentation contents from https://xsai.js.org/llms.txt
2. Use the following prompt format:

```
