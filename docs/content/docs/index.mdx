## What is xsAI?

xsAI is a series of utils to help you use OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible API.

## Why use the xsAI?

xsAI has a similar interface to the Vercel AI SDK, but smaller.

This makes it ideal for a variety of scenarios that require smaller bundle size, such as web applications, cli running through npx, and so on.

### So how small is xsAI?

Without further ado, let's look at the results from https://pkg-size.dev:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 16, gzipped: 5.8, installed: 93, name: 'xsai@0.1.2' },
  { bundled: 222, gzipped: 57, installed: 9534, name: 'ai@4.1.54' },
]} />

xsAI reduces the installation size 100x and the bundle size 10x.

And it could be smaller!

If you only need basic text generation, you can just install the `@xsai/generate-text` package:

<PkgSizeChart data={[
  { bundled: 2.9, gzipped: 1.4, installed: 19, name: '@xsai/generate-text@0.1.2' },
  { bundled: 16, gzipped: 5.8, installed: 93, name: 'xsai@0.1.2' },
]} />
