<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="There are too many packages for xsAI, how do I manage the versions?">
    If you are using pnpm, you can use [pnpm catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs) with [yaml anchors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases):

    ```yaml
    # pnpm-workspace.yaml
    catalog:
      '@xsai/embed': &xsai ^0.1.0
      '@xsai/generate-text': *xsai
      '@xsai/shared': *xsai
      '@xsai/shared-chat': *xsai
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ðŸ‘† Is there a simpler / workspace-less way?">
    Yes, you can install the `xsai` package, which contains all the core utils.

    See [xsai](./top-level/xsai) for more information.
